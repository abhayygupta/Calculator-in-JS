This is a calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtration, multiplication, division, etc.

Extra Add-Ons:
1) Other than clicking the buttons on screen, you can also type on your keyboard to use calculator. such as  typing 3+3 gives the correct output i.e 6.
2) There is a toggleTheme button that changes the background color of the calculator.
3) A simple calculator just cuts off the digits that doesnt fit its input box. This one Shrinks the text to fit the input box like a real application with scroll horizontally available too!
